# Sales Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to clean and prepare raw sales data using Python and pandas. The dataset contained inconsistencies such as duplicate entries, inconsistent text formatting, and numeric values stored as strings. The goal was to transform the raw data into a clean, usable CSV file for analysis.

## Tools & Technologies 
- **pandas** for data manipulation  
- **VS Code** for development  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  

## Features
- Loads raw sales data from CSV  
- Cleans text columns 
- Converts numeric columns to correct data types  
- Handles missing or invalid data  
- Saves the cleaned dataset to `sales_data_clean.csv`  

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.  
2. Install dependencies:
   python3 -m pip install pandas
   push run button, and see cleaned results 


Run data and clean script: 
python3 src/data_cleaning.py

Learned Outcomes: 
I gained expereince with github, visual studio, and praticed my python skills 

I learned how to clean data and handle missing values 

I practiced and learned collaberation workflow between the data, and all the different programs I was using
