# Data Cleaning Project Reflection
# Chloe Cunningham 

This project helped me understand the real-world process of cleaning and preparing raw data using Python. At the beginning of this assignment, I was unsure how GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and Python would all work together, but by completing each step, I gained confidence in using all three. It was difficult for me as i HAVE OLY USED gitHub once before. However, I am much more confident in my abilities now. 

One of the first challenges I faced was setting up my environment correctly. I learned how to install Python packages using `pip`, verify that my CSV file was in the correct folder, and properly run my script from the terminal. I am not familair with Visual Studio code either, so finding each proper function and button was difficult. It made seeing my code work properly however even more rewarding. 

Writing the `load_data()` function helped me understand how to load external files into a Python program using pandas. Cleaning the column names showed me how inconsistent data formatting can be fixed with simple string transformations. I thought it was extremely helpful to be provided the fiole and information that needed cleaning. I also learned how errors can happen when working with numeric data that still contains text, and how to debug those errors by inspecting the output.

Using GitHub was a major skill I improved upon in this project. I made multiple commits as I completed each step, which taught me how version control works and why frequent commits are important. Pushing my updates to GitHub made the project feel more organzied, and understandable.

Overall, this project taught me that data cleaning is one of the most important steps in data analysis. Raw data is rarely perfect, and knowing how to clean and validate it makes everything else possible. I now feel much more comfortable using Python, pandas, VS Code, and GitHub together in one workflow. These programs displayed to me what major businesses do to clean their data, and how the organzie millions of lines of code and information.
